Open Surveyor
=============

Open Surveyor is a mobile application for convenient data collection for OpenStreetMap mappers. It is written 
under [Google Summer of Code'2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/positron96/1) 
program.

Most of development documentation will go to [github wiki](https://github.com/positron96/opensurveyor/wiki).

[OpenStreetMap wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2013/OpenSurveyor) containts 
timeline and progress of development, and GSoC inoformation.

OpenSurveyor is an Android application, though data storage and presets format are XML-based 
and published in the wiki. Also, I am trying to write it in the most architecture-independent
way as possible (though I make heavy use of Java features). So I hope that porting it to, say, 
iOS will not be that difficult, as well as making other apps that serve similar purpose
(data collection) but have different interface.
